## Rezervak GJKT

Rezervak GJKT is a reservation system for a school cottage that was made as my graduation project in high school.
It uses Next.js 14 with server actions, Tailwind, Typescript (not so much), SQL, MySql DB under the hood.
If you want to run it localy, feel free to email me for more info. But you really dont want to contribute, ain't you?
BTW you can try it live <a href="https://chata.gjkt.cz/">here</a>. Give it a try and leave me a ‚≠ê.
